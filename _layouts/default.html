							<h2>Overview of the project</h2>
							<p>
This project was an exciting fusion of creative writing and artificial intelligence to help writers create
new forms of dynamic, interactive stories. It specifically aimed to understand what the impact of
artificially-intelligent memory is on storytelling and narrative structure, and how to transfer the
resulting research into industry.</p>

<p>The project was a collaboration between To Play For, a pioneer in interactive storytelling, and a cross-
disciplinary team at King's College London covering digital humanities, culture and software
engineering. Together these two teams will undertook the research and development required to
interrogate the complexity of memory as a concept in interactive storytelling and the impact that
this can have on the story experience. The partnership will leverage To Play For's interactive
storytelling technology, Charisma.AI, as a research tool and commercialisation platform.</p>

<p>This major new innovation will open up opportunities for creative industries across all media who are
interested in harnessing the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence for their craft in
writing stories. It will act as both a tutorial and an accelerator for new creative processes, opening
up new publishing opportunities, jobs and revenue streams, keeping the UK at the forefront of
established and newly emerging creative industries.</p>

							<h2>For King & Country</h2>
							
							
<blockquote>
It’s December 1940 and a Nazi invasion force has landed on the south coast of England.  As the invasion force prepares to strike north and capture London, King Edward VIII refuses the resignation of British Prime Minister Lord Halifax, triggering a constitutional crisis.​  Parliament is recalled, and with all the members of both houses meeting in Westminster, a small group of backbench MPs and their families – designated survivors – are taken to a secure location south of the river Thames. They are completely unaware of the imminent events that will thrust them into the limelight, and put the fate of the nation in their hands.You are among those designated survivors. Your decisions will shape the course of history. </blockquote>

							</ul>
							<p>In 2018, To Play For and <a href="https://www.parabolictheatre.com/for-king-and-country">Parabolic Theatre</a> partnered to create a Unity game based on Parabolic’s immersive theatre show For King and Country.  This collaboration became the first test case for the AI & Storytelling project.  The audience - which forms a rump parliament in the show - was replaced by AI characters created in the Charisma system.  The project experimented with the role of memory in persistent storytelling by creating AI characters that interacted with the player, mis/remember what they’d said, lie and remember when they were lied to.</p>
<p>
The collaboration evolved during the game’s development.  Project Co-Investigator Elliott Hall of KDL became the primary writer of the game, working with the To Play For development team to produce a showcase demo and experiment with narrative possibilities of the Charisma UI.

							<h2>The Kraken Wakes</h2>
							<blockquote>“It started with fireballs raining down from the sky and crashing into the oceans' deeps. Then ships began sinking mysteriously and later 'sea tanks' emerged from the deeps to claim people . . .

For journalists Mike and Phyllis Watson, what at first appears to be a curiosity becomes a global calamity. Helpless, they watch as humanity struggles to survive now that water - one of the compounds upon which life depends - is turned against them. Finally, sea levels begin their inexorable rise . . .

The Kraken Wakes is a brilliant novel of how humankind responds to the threat of its own extinction and, ultimately, asks what we are prepared to do in order to survive.</blockquote>

									<h4>Sarah Atkinson</h4>
									<p>
										In the context of the very real exponential increase in the complexity and creative potential in AI, in applications as varied as banking, medicine, national security and entertainment there is also a dominant narrative of the obsolescence of human employment and creativity brought about through the rise of  these new smarter better technologies.

							<h2>Next steps</h2>
							<p>
								A key challenge identified during the project has been finding and developing people with a range of technical and creative skills to engage in this type of multidisciplinary work. The first step for taking the project forward will be exploring the possibility of a Knowledge Transfer Partnership with To Play For to allow Elliott
Hall to work with writers who are new to the Charisma system, passing on the
knowledge gained during the showcase development, while at the same time
studying the framework for how these skills can be shared. If that model
proves successful, the lab would begin investigating how it could be scaled up
and standardised for industry. Further Partnerships between universities and
SMEs in the creative industries will be essential for taking this work forward.
							</p>
							<p>
								King’s Digital Lab has begun to invest in Digital Creativity across a range of
disciplines, including film, video games, VR/AR and immersive performance.  The work developed during the project is now being used as a test case for developing a standardised pipeline between Research Software Engineers (RSE) and the creative industry. The lab is now exploring combining the informal collaborative structures developed on an adhoc basis during the project phase – enlisting RSEs with creative and technical backgrounds to embed directly in industry teams, combining that practice work by RSEs with ethnographic study by other members of the lab – with the lab’s existing working methods for collaborating with academics to create a new process better suited to needs of the creative industries. This work is directly informed by the feedback from both academia and industry received during the project workshops.
							</p>

							<p>To Play For continue to explore opportunities across media, publishing and education sectors to leverage the learnings and exploit the platform enhancements developed during the project.</p>
